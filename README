This script can pull ntlmssp hashes with the challenge/response from a pcap.

It's pretty slow, and i'm not entirely sure if it gets the correct server challenge yet.

My old method, seen here (http://psychomari0.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/pcaptontlmssp/) doesn't
seem to work becuase the username is unicode and the -z to show the username is null terminated

USAGE:
python ntlmssp.py <outfile.pcap>

!!IMPORTANT!!
You MUST run:
    tshark -r <file>.pcap 'ntlmssp.ntlmserverchallenge or ntlmssp.ntlmclientchallenge' -w <outfile.pcap>
before running this program, or it will take ages.
